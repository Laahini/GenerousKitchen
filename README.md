# GenerousKitchen
Generous Kitchen is a student-led initiative that focuses on providing food to all who are in need throughout Indonesia. We also aim to bring awareness to child malnutrition and the importance of food in a hunger-driven world.


If you would like to help support us in our goal of helping future generations and fighting hunger, please consider volunteering and applying to a leadership position or as part of our team. These roles vary from helping us deliver goods to malnourished children to writing publications for our blog. We will provide certificates as proof of your volunteer service upon request.
